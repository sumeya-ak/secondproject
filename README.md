This Java application is a graphical user interface (GUI) for a vegetable and fruit store. It allows users to sell items, print the current stock, report sales, and exit the application.
●	The program creates a basic store interface where users can:
         ○	Sell items by entering the name and quantity.
         ○	Print stock to see the available items and their quantities.
         ○	Report sales to view a log of all sales made.
         ○	Exit the application using a button.
The GUI responds to user actions and provides feedback on sales and stock through text areas. It also ensures proper handling of edge cases (like insufficient stock or non-existent items).
